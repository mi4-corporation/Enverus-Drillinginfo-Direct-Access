## The Direct Access API

Enverus Drillinginfo’s Direct Access API provides simple programmatic access to Drillinginfo database servers. The Direct Access API is available to DI Plus customers and allows for direct data imports to data warehouses or internal applications.

Direct Access Version 2 is the most recent API version and is replacing Direct Access Version 1.
